# Intro
 I’m Makay Crandall—a passionate and curious data science student with a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, and data visualization. I love turning messy data into meaningful insights, whether through predictive modeling, interactive dashboards, or compelling visual stories. With hands-on experience in projects ranging from sports analytics to real estate classification, I aim to bridge the gap between raw data and real-world impact. I’m currently pursuing my degree in computer science and always looking for new challenges that combine creativity, critical thinking, and code.
